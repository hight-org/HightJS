## ⚠️ Deprecated

> **HightJS is officially deprecated.**  
> This project is **no longer maintained** and will not receive updates, bug fixes, or new features.

It has been succeeded by a new and improved framework:

### 👉 **Nyte.js**
A next-generation full-stack framework focused on performance, developer experience, and clean architecture.

🔗 **Repository:** https://github.com/murillo-frazao-cunha/nyte  
📦 **NPM:** https://www.npmjs.com/package/nyte

## ❓ Why was HightJS deprecated?

HightJS served as an experimental foundation, but over time architectural limitations became clear.

**Nyte.js** was built to address these issues with:

- A more robust and scalable architecture
- Cleaner and safer APIs
- Better frontend/backend separation
- Modern RPC system
- Improved TypeScript support
- Long-term maintainability

---

## 🔁 Migration

If you are currently using HightJS, **we strongly recommend migrating to Nyte.js**.

Migration guides and updated examples are available in the Nyte.js repository.
